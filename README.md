# Dagger 2 (Java and Android)

This project is split into 2 parts: Java code and Android code.

   and IntelliJ IDEA. To load them in your IDE, make sure to import a Maven
   project and IDEA will take care of the rest.
2. **Android** - There is 1 example in the [`android/`](https://github.com/nazmulidris/dagger2/tree/master/android) folder. Import the project into
   Android Studio (as a gradle project).
