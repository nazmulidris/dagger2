# Dagger 2 (Java and Android)

This project is split into 2 parts: Java code and Android code.

1. **Java** - There are 2 examples in the `java/` folder. They're created using Maven
   and IntelliJ IDEA. To load them in your IDE, make sure to import a Maven
   project and IDEA will take care of the rest.
2. **Android** - There is 1 example in the `android/` folder. Import the project into
   Android Studio (as a gradle project).
